    "# III - eSBAE Time-Series Extraction\n",
    "### Extract various time-series data for large sets of points from Google Earth Engine\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through the process of extracting time-series information for a set of points using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). The script is optimized to deal with thousands of points and will use parallelization to efficiently extract the information from the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will need**:\n",
    "- a valid Earth Engine account ([sign up here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register))\n",
    "- an uploaded table of points (Feature Collection) \n",
    "- the table needs a unique point identifier (Point ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should be aware, that:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- As a SEPAL user: this notebook does **not need huge resources**, as processing is done on the platform. An **m2 instance** is best suited.  \n",
    "- The extraction can take up to days (>100000 points). If you are on SEPAL, make use of the **\"keep instance running\"** option within the user report dashboard.\n",
    "  - You do this by clicking on the cost per hour shown at the bottom right of your screen. Select the edit button on the right side under \"sessions\", then move the slider to the right until several days are selected and close the window. However, **do not forget** to shut down your machine once processing has finished or you will continue to be charged. \n",
    "- Interruption of connectivity to the SEPAL server may block the output of the Jupyter notebook. **This does not mean the processing stopped.** A logfile is created within your \"tmp\" folder where you can check if there is an issue.\n",
    "    - Go to your \"tmp\" folder by making sure the File Browser icon is selected from the four tabs on the left of your Jupyter Notebooks screen, then click on the folder icon on the far left of the displayed path to your working folder. This will take you one directory up from your working folder where the \"tmp\" folder is located. Inside the \"tmp\" folder you can see the \"Last Modified\" times. Check to see that the last modified time was within the last few minutes when you ran the code cell (proving the processing is still ongoing). If the last modified time seems far too long ago, try checking your instance is still active (there should be a non-zero cost per hour on the bottom of your screen) and then **restarting the kernel and running all the cells again**.  \n",
    "- If you restart the kernel and execute all cells, extraction will **start where it stopped**. This is also valid if your instance has been shut down before processing was completely finished."
